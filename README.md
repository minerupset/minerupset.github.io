# Welcome to the factory!

This is all well and good to see pretty content on the internet, but oftentimes, it can be helpful to see exactly how something is being written. This is where I keep the code for this blog, written in MkDocs, with some of the underlying elements as well.

## INO Future Post List

These are in no particular order, but these are posts that I will write:

- How to solve a Rubik's Cube in under 2 minutes

  - Solve it in layers, and the centers never change
  - The top layers require the most logic
  - The bottom layer is just algorithms (embed a YouTube video)
  - puzzles, games

- Unpermitted work and what they can actually do to you
  - home ownership, diy
- Things I wish I knew before buying a house
  - Make your goals
  - home ownership, finance, adulting
- What to do when your loan company is actually a scam

  - May need to make this a series:
    - How to handle getting a default notice (when you haven't defaulted)
      - CFPB, state protections, etc.
    - Why OneNote is the best tool for documenting ongoing BS
  - home ownership, finance, adulting, Microsoft Office

- What I know about chess so far (and what I need to learn next)
  - games, chess
- Any example coding projects I've done lately (can put any of these as public github repos)
  - The Journal
    - The Recipe app
  - Maze Solver in VBA
- Guitar / Piano stuff
  - music, guitar, piano
  - Guitar in the more 'here's how to do it', piano in the vein of "here's something I just learned"
