# Miner Curiosity

<hr>
Welcome. I'm not sure how you got here, but you're here now. It's nice to see you.

I started this blog for two reasons:

1. To help myself keep track of tips, tricks, and other things I pick up related to the wide-world of code
2. To maybe one day help other people answer the same questions I've had over my time

I didn't make this explicitly as a training site, so if you don't like the way I explain something / it's not as elegant as it could be, I'm honestly ok with that. That's why I don't have any comments on here - no sense in feeding the trolls. I will however do my best to not post anything that's flat out wrong, though.

## How this site is organized

<hr>
In a word: haphazardly. But learning, and especially learning software, can be haphazard. It is a bit of a truism that _"Computer outputs are rarely wrong; more often, we are wrong about what input or logic we give them."_ And while I agree with this, it doesn't mean there aren't some 'magic' steps we have to take to get our apps to work. I was never good at remembering magic steps. But you know what is? A computer.

I work mostly with C#, Python, and JavaScript / TypeScript (very occasionally). I often find I spend a day breaking through some wall in a project, get super distracted by life, and then a month later, I come back and can't even remember the project, let alone the wall I had to break through.

This is, simply put, bad for business. So, I've started to organize different topics to help me remember what things I did to solve problems; connecting to this or that database, the best way to write a unit test, and so on.

I will try and organize topics first by language, and then grouping ideas together. Where relevant, I'll also try and cross reference similar themes from one language to another, whether highlighting similarities or differences. I won't pretend I'll be deeply rigorous on those elements, but I'll try and be as consistent as I can, and cite my sources so that I'm not just a crackpot.

I have historically worked exclusively with Microsoft and Windows, but I am making the push towards UNIX based systems (currently working on a Mac). There may be a bit of cross over between the `Ctrl` key and the `Command` key, but you should be able to figure that out with some quick searching.

## Acknowledgements / Where I Learn the Most

<hr>
I'm a big fan of internet-based learning (obviously), and there are a number of resources and teachers who have made my life significantly easier when working through coding projects:

- StackOverflow, despite its many flaws and fiefdoms, remains a great place to learn why the f\*\*k something isn't working the way you'd expect. Learning to search for the right question is important, but rarely do I find nothing on the topic.
- YouTube, and specifically Mosh Hamedani, have been very helpful to me. Mosh makes great videos that go through a good balance of theory with the actual practical application of the next steps, and it's hard to not be impressed with his enthusiasm for the material.
- Documentation and GitHub issue reports are truly invaluable. They can often be intimidating at first, because it's experienced people talking about complicated things, and it's hard to follow. However, if you take your time, search for things you don't learn, and keep notes to refer back to, you begin to absorb so much more from the docs.

_Note, I received no compensation for these acknowledgements. I always struggled in finding the best resources, and knowledge is best when shared_

## Why MkDocs?

<hr>
Well, why anyone picks any option - a combination of good-enough and decision fatigue. With MkDocs, it was mostly the former. The boxes it checks for me are:

- Simple writing with Markdown
- Deployment to GitHub Pages is a breeze
- Basic but powerful search functionality
- Simple, effective themes (currently using <a href='https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/' target='_blank'>Material</a>)
- I don't need dates and tags (for now), but instead just need very basic organization

Honestly, I'll probably end up upgrading to something else in the future (if you have any recommendations, think them really hard at me, because I don't have any commenting ability) but for now, this is enough for me. Perfect is indeed, the enemy of good.
