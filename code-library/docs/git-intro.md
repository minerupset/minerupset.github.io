# Git and GitHub

## Quick Overview

There are a boatload of tutorials on git and GitHub across the internet, so I'm not going to waste a lot of time here - this <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html" target="_blank">tutorial here</a> from GitLab is a great introductory one to using git on the command line.

In a nutshell, git is source control. What that means is instead of saving each version of your files as "\_v1", "\_v2", etc., you instead track changes with git, which can compare different versions and branches of files over time. Now, git itself only runs locally on your machine, but that's why you extend git with GitHub (where this site is hosted as of this writing, in fact). GitHub allows you to push your code repositories to an online site (or Hub, one might call it), that allows you to work on the same code from multiple machines, share code with friends and teammates, or even deploy from a single spot.

I am of two minds on how to start with git/GitHub: I started with <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> and at the time of this writing, am trying to get better at local git and pushing it to remote repositories on GitHub. While I think that git from the command line is ultimately a useful tool, to be honest, I have not historically thought "in the command line". I'm a visual person, and seeing a desktop app that I can do click and push is very helpful. That being said, when you obscure some of the magic behind a UI, it can actually damage your understanding of what exactly you're doing. Git is nuanced enough that I think a strong CLI understanding of its functionality will serve you well, so I recommend, if not starting with the git CLI, definitely don't avoid it.
