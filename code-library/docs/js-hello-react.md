## What is React and Why Bother?

<hr>
React is a front-end specific library (not framework) for creating responsive user interfaces (UIs). On the back end, it does this by creating a virtual DOM that it can quickly compare over time, and then update the real DOM. This is much cheaper from a CPU and memory perspective than trying to compare the full DOM over time; it's just not realistic.
