## What is jQuery and Why Bother?

<hr>
Before there were discussions about React vs. Angular vs. Vue and all the other potential front-ends, jQuery was the technology for building and deploying basic dynamic functionality to web application front-ends. jQuery is used in almost 75% of the world's most popular websites (as of 2019). It is essentially a DOM-manipulation tool, creating a simple and easy layer to manipulate the DOM in real time, based on events. It also provides an easy layer for making AJAX calls (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML) to a web server.

While many front-end frameworks do away with or do not require jQuery, it is one of the original technologies in the space (dating back to 2006). Even if you never use jQuery in one of your own applications, a solid understanding of its methods and principles is incredibly valuable to understand how many existing web applications function, as well as how modern front-end frameworks evolved beyond jQuery.
