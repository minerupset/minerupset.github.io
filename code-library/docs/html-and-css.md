# HTML and CSS - the Building Blocks

## A Reminder about Tools

Web development can often look like a large, scary beast, with so many tools and steps and requirements and everything pulling every which way. This becomes true of any field, once you get deep enough into it. At the core though, it's all pretty simple: web browsers read HTML and CSS and make them look a certain way on a webpage (statically). Javascript can make your pages [dynamic*](`#`resources-and-references), but we don't need that right now. HTML and CSS are all you need to make a webpage display in a browser. 

Everything else on top of this - React components and Node servers and APIs and all that jazz, at the end of the day, resolve to someone somewhere having the right HTML and CSS put in front of them. _**Many of the core tools you'll use manipulate HTML and CSS in one way or another so that you're not manually typing out web pages.**_ Everything else, like video encoding, downloading files, and dynamic web apps are all details that come later.

1. Yes, I know that HTML and CSS can have some dynamic elements to them too, but like any high level topic, we start with the simple lies and eventually build to uncomfortable truths.
