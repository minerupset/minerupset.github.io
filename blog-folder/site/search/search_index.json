Not necessarily because I wanted other people to listen (though it is always nice) but instead because it was loud in the space between my ears and writing seemed to quiet things down. I've started and stopped I don't know how many journals and blogs and voice recording habits, and I'd be lying if I said I knew why. The best I can think of is this example:</p> <p>When I was in my 5th year of college running, I was struggling to find motivation. I was running better than I ever had, and knew that success was within reach, but I ultimately felt detached from my goal. What finally clicked, or at least what coincided with good motivation and performance, was when I started trying to perform for other people. As unexpected as it was, convincing myself that running was a good thing for those around me helped me get out the door, do the right stretches, and mentally prepare for the races to come. I didn't achieve all I hoped to, but I certainly achieved enough to say that I \"succeeded\". Not only that, but when the wheels eventually came off, I can easily trace it back to how I had lost that focus and become more selfish in my pursuits.</p> <p>Perhaps summed up better is a quote by John Green, author and Vlogbrother1</p>  <p>Quote</p> <p>Don't make stuff because you want to make money: it will never make you enough money. Don't make stuff because you want to get famous, because you will never feel famous enough. Make gifts for people. And work hard on making those gifts in the hope that those people will notice. Maybe they will notice how hard you worked, and maybe they won't. ...But ultimately, that doesn't change anything because your responsibility isn't to the people you're making the gift for but to the gift itself.</p>  <p>It didn't matter whether or not the people I was running for cared about what I was doing, but the fact that I wanted to deliver something for them gave me a focus I wouldn't have had otherwise.

All you need is the experience to share, the willingness to do so, and enough of the knowhow to make it possible.

Or put another way, you can't iterate in an Excel formula. There are a few things that can (Data tables, Goal Seeks, etc.) but a formula result is a formula result, and that's it.</p> <p>Let me give an example of what I mean by 'you can't iterate':</p> An Impossible formula<pre><code>' You cannot do this in an Excel Formula\n=WHILE(A1 &lt; 5, B1 = B1 + 1)\n\n' No no not allowed\n</code></pre> <p>Once an Excel workbook is finished calculating, it needs to be static. You edit a cell, it recalculates, and then it stops. You edit another cell, it recalculates, then it stops. This is possible because Excel works off of a calculation chain to handle this order of events, called a dependency chain2: if A1 depends on B2 which depends on C3, then C3 is calculated first, then B2, then A1. This is how Excel determines if you have any circular references in the workbook, and in particularly large and nasty Excel files, if you make a change you may see everything hang for 30 seconds while your computer fan spins up a jet engine to cool off.</p>","title":"Setting the Stage: Static Workbooks"},{"location":"2021/Excel-Lambda-Functions/#lambda-function-breaks-the-chain-not-really3","tags":["Excel"],"text":"<p>In software development, a lambda function is a construct used in many languages, including Python, JavaScript, C#, and others (though it's sometimes called an anonymous function). Originally comes from lambda calculus - thanks Wikipedia4 - lambda functions essentially allow a user to define a function, and then pass it around as a variable.</p> <p>That is a boring definition.</p> <p>Practically speaking, a lambda function allows you to define a function on the go, without the computer having known beforehand what exactly the function will do. The LAMBDA function in Excel allows a user to define their own function, and then call it whenever they want. Here's an example:</p> Basic additive LAMBDA function<pre><code>=LAMBDA(x,y,x+y)(1,2)\n</code></pre> <p>Breaking down the components, you can see the arguments are made up of</p> <ul> <li>The function call: <code>=LAMBDA(</code></li> <li>The parameters to the function: <code>x,y,</code></li> <li>The function formula: <code>x+y)</code></li> <li>and the specific values for this function <code>(1,2)</code></li> </ul> <p>So this would return the result of 1+2 or 3. This example on its own isn't that special, but the real beauty of the LAMBDA function is two fold:</p> <ol> <li>You can name functions (using the Name Manager), so our function above could be called 'ADDTWOVALUES' if you'd like, and</li> <li>You can call functions recursively</li> </ol> <p>This second point is the real big change that Excel has never done before. Calling functions recursively is essentially a backdoor to writing new logical flow statements (while loops, for loops, etc.) that are more dynamic rather than Excel's traditional static structure.

The last thing you want is to have spent a day debugging, adding a new feature, or deploying only to find you've been working with an out-of-date codebase.</p> <p>Software developers like having automated tools for everything, and version control is no exception. git is not just one such tool, it is the tool. Instead of saving each version of your files as \"_v1\", \"_v2\", etc., you track changes with git, which can compare different versions and branches of files over time.

That being said, I'm not joining the crowd to grab my torch and pitchfork just yet: Excel (and by extension, Google Sheets) is still one of the simplest and fastest ways for people to do practical math, and it is here to stay3.

Experienced developers can look down on the tinker-toys that Excel has to offer, with its static processing, point-and-click interface, and the garbage pile that is VBA syntax compared to most modern languages.

So many aspiring developers want to know exactly how something works, but eventually you have to just accept that some steps are magic steps, and there is a small wizard in there executing 0s and 1s. There's nothing wrong with learning how to build compilers or write in Assembly, but it's foolhardy to try and become a jack of all trades in software.</p> <p>I personally believe this acceptance should be reached early: not because curiosity is bad, but because it spreads attention too thin. How can you truly learn a single concept if you're trying to learn every concept at once? In more traditional languages (Python, Java, C#, etc.) developers invest heavily in 'inventing the universe'. Before you can begin to explore functions and methods for objects and their properties, you have to fully define every single one of those objects, all of their properties, how they interact, and of course deal with the errors along the way. That is, at best, a tedious process.</p> <p>With Excel, you have a ready-built environment to experiment with right away. Want to click a button that makes a cell change color?

In less than a week I was convinced the field wasn't for me (I've heard Java has that effect on people), and I barely touched anything coding related for 7 years.</p> <p>Jump to my first 'real' job after after grad school, and within 6 months of joining I was teaching myself to code in the evenings, speeding up my job and improving outputs for clients. Within 2 years I had deployed multiple solutions company wide, automated several processes, and was leading the company training on Excel. It wasn't that I had more time on my hands (I didn't), nor was I suddenly smarter (I wasn't): instead, I had more problems that needed practical solutions.</p> <p>During that first course in college, I remember our final project was building a maze solver based on different sorting algorithms. A generous friend of mine dragged me kicking and screaming through that project, largely because I couldn't see a practical application for the assignment. When would I ever need to solve a maze? My friend however, went on to become a software engineer at Garmin: for him, that project was phenomenal practice for his future career. For me, I may have preferred a root canal.</p> <p>In the last few decades there has been a practical need for spreadsheets that are cleaner, faster, and more powerful, and I don't see that trend slowing yet. This means opportunities abound, and you're only limited by those practical needs. Since I first started using Excel seriously, I've built projects and models large and small, from retirement calculators and train schedule tools to an automated meeting scheduler, an investment portfolio tracker, a mortgage and budget calculator, and countless others. I didn't go and convince myself that learning to send meeting invitations would somehow help me in theory: I needed to send 60+ unique but mostly similar meeting emails every week for the foreseeable future, and I decided to spend my time solving a puzzle rather than completing a mindless task.</p> <p>If I had built that scheduler with Python, it would have been too intimidating to even begin. But since Excel already has so many of the necessary components built-in and a simple interface for storing data, it was simply a matter of trial &amp; error, refining the user experience until I had a tool that saved me hours and my company tens of thousands of dollars a year.</p>","title":"Practicality From the Beginning"},{"location":"2021/Why-Excel-and-VBA/#groundbreaking-concepts-bite-sized-projects","tags":["Excel","VBA","Software"],"text":"<p>While Excel's claim to fame is financial modeling, its structure and backend language make it very useful for learning higher level software concepts quickly and easily.

I had dozens of screenshots showing issues with this company's website, but I intentionally limited it to specific, unambiguous issues. It's far better to have 3 clear examples of wrongdoing than 3 examples of clear wrongdoing and 2 of a misunderstanding.</li> <li>Compile it all into a cleanly formatted document. You're going to be sending this to a number of different people, so make sure you do a good job of spellchecking, formatting, etc. Get someone else to read it over if you need: put an emphasis on clear and direct language. Not aggressive, just unambiguous.</li> <li>Address it to all parties involved. When we did this, we printed 5 copies of the letter, addressed each one to one of the different groups we were sending to (4 agencies total and the scammers themselves) and wrote in each letter that we had written to all 5 of the groups. You want everyone to know that this is being widely distributed, like cc'ing on an email.</li> <li>Send it with certified mail. This will cost you some money (about $20 per letter) but it is absolutely required. According to the lawyers I spoke with, certified mail is basically 'undeniable'. The scamming group in question can't pretend that they didn't receive it, they can't claim ignorance, and if you have to take them to court, certified mail is your proof positive that they heard your message.</li> </ol> <p>I know this can be a lot of frustrating steps, so if you need help from someone else, find a friend or family member who can help be your project manager.

And while there are a number of potential investment classes to look at, the main three I think of are:</p> <ol> <li>The stock market</li> <li>Real estate</li> <li>Cryptocurrency (yes, cryptocurrency)</li> </ol> <p>I am not suggesting that you invest in all of these equally, or that you even have to use all of them. If Bitcoin seems stupid to you, don't invest in it. I'm not going to proselytize here.</p> <p>The question is, do you want to manage different accounts and reporting taxes and gains on each one year over year? In the grand scheme it's not that much work, but if you value not having to think about paperwork during tax season, then maybe only pick one of these investments. It's riskier from a diversification lens, but the important thing is going with what you value and are comfortable with.</p> <p>Let's talk logistics though: what would it look like to invest in these asset classes?</p>","title":"Where Should You Invest?"},{"location":"2022/First-Nest-Egg/#the-stock-market","tags":["Personal Finance","Investing"],"text":"<p>There is way too much information out there on the stock market, so I will keep this brief. You want to open up an account with a trusted online investment brokerage where you can buy and sell equities (stocks, ETFs, index funds, etc.) through their web application. The ones I've found most useful are Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, though there are plenty of other no-fee traders. A few points to remember (do further research on each of these points if you want to learn more):</p> <ul> <li>Consistently beating the market as a whole is nearly impossible. I don't care how smart you think you are or how many times you've watched The Big Short, you will lose money. Do yourself a favor and buy ETFs and index funds</li> <li>Depending on your income level, you may be able to invest your money in a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account). If you can, you should open that kind of account. It allows all of your gains to grow tax free, and you can put in $6,000 / year in 20222</li> <li>In a non-retirement account, you pay taxes on any capital gains (your profit from a sale). So if you buy a stock at $25, sell it for $100, immediately buy another stock for $100 and then lose it all, the government doesn't care that you have no money: you technically made $75 worth of profit on that first sale, and you need to pay taxes on it. That's why I personally suggest only buying stocks you plan to hold for a long time and thinking through the taxes before you sell out of a position</li> <li>Free trading platforms aren't really free, and some shady groups have come in (Robinhood is one I would avoid). One could argue that the older brokerage firms are also shady - they are - but I prefer my chances with the tried and true</li> </ul>","title":"The Stock Market"},{"location":"2022/First-Nest-Egg/#real-estate","tags":["Personal Finance","Investing"],"text":"<p>I'll let you in on a secret: I'm a homeowner who's about to go back to renting. Why? Because owning your own property can sometimes suck. Maintenance and repairs can be hideously expensive, and when contractors are booked out 9+ months in advance and the city is backlogged on getting permits, it doesn't matter how handy you are, you're up the creek if you need to do some bigger work. Do I sound bitter? Too bad. Essentially, real estate is not as passive as you think.</p> <p>Luckily, you don't need to buy your own house or storefront to invest in real estate. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) allow you to invest in real estate similar to the stock market, and provide an easy way to get exposed to the market. Personally, I strongly recommend Fundrise: you give them money, they buy commercial real estate that most normal people don't have access to, you make money, and their advisory fees are quite small.
