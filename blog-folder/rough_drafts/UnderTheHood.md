An idea I have for pieces is to make 'under the hood' pieces where I dive in a bit more into Excel and VBA, listing all the ways it does (and doesn't work). Things like:

- How Excel files are actually zip folders and you can modify specific values
- The best times to use Arrays vs. Collections in VBA
- Why the VBA Dictionary is so powerful
- Connecting to other VBA libraries, like Outlook

As well, I was going to do a deep dive on every single formula in Excel. Maybe not EVERY SINGLE, but a lot of them
