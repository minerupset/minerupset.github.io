# How I Managed To Avoid a Scam Foreclosure

_Legal Disclaimer here_

It's not fun, but I'll show you the steps I took to organize the information

## Quick Background

What happened to us (refinance, new company, etc.)

This could happen to you with a home loan, working with a contractor, a warranty, a car loan, all kinds of things.

## Step #0: Take a Deep Breath

A quote that I have used time and again has been, "Once you've decided to be angry, it doesn't help being angry anymore." Emotions can be very useful for getting you to a decision point, but make sure you don't let the emotion go too far. Keep your head about you and you'll be ok.

## Step #1: Get a System

The way you beat these things is by being organized. Just saying someone did you wrong isn't going to help much, but screenshots, recordings, and documents are very hard to deny. To pull that off, you need a consistent location to store all of your thoughts and information on what's going on, and you'll want to be able to search for it as well.

For this particular situation, I used Microsoft OneNote, but there are other free and paid services you can use. If I were to do it again, I would probably go with Notion: it's free and very powerful.

## Step #2: Information is Your Friend

Scammers try and pressure you with short time and big, scary sounding repercussions if you don't do what they say. Our very first contact from the company was a foreclosure letter. No welcome email, no introduction, nothing. Just a letter stating we owed them over $7,000 and that we would lose the house in 45 days. The way you take back power in this situation is to get educated. Now that you have a system for storing all your information, let's use it.

I made a daily post, titled with the date, detailing any activity that happened. If I logged in, if I had a phone call, if I got a form or a letter or email: everything was stored in there. It doesn't need to be long or well written, just recorded so that you can look back, know what happened, and share that information with the right people.

## Step #3 Be Clear About What Resolution is

I have a lawyer friend who said, "I'm not here to make someone feel better: that's a therapist's job. I'm here to get them justice." For us, someone was trying to take our house (or at least, make us pay ~$7,000 as extortion for not foreclosing on us). The two main things we wanted were for that foreclosure notice to go away and for them to refund our escrow account (since we couldn't trust them anymore). While I had all kinds of frustrations with who they were as people, as my lawyer friend said, that's a conversation best for a therapist. I had to be very clear in all of my communications about what a 'correct' resolution would look like.

This can be a bit challenging because to find a resolution, you have to get very concrete about what they did that was wrong. The company sending me an email that scared me isn't illegal: that's a purely subjective thing. But I took the time, read up on the law (if you're in this situation, the law you're looking for is RESPA[^1]) and found clear clauses that they had violated, such as not honoring payments during a 60-day grace period. You're not going after the soft fuzzy thing they did that bothered you: your focus should be on the very clear, one sentence statement, "They did X, and that is illegal because of Y".

Once you have that vision of what a resolution is, make that the clear goal. I wouldn't have said no to dunking their C-suite in a vat of acid, but that wasn't my goal so I had to leave it behind.

## Step #4: Really Record Everything

When I said I made a post of everything that happened, I mean everything. If you get an email, copy and paste all of the text from the email into your daily post. Write a quick blurb at the top saying who you got it from, when, and your initial reactions.

If you have a phone call, record it. In the same way you hear, "This call may be monitored for training purposes" when someone calls you, you can do the same thing back. Inform them that you are recording the call (...steps on how to record).

## Step #5: Find the Adult in the Room

This may be the single most important point here, if only because it brings it all together: the only thing that stops a bad lawyer is a good lawyer. If you are getting scammed, you need to find the right group who is invested in making sure this doesn't happen. I live in California, a state that luckily has many consumer protections: I wound up reaching out to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (a national organization), the California Department of Financial Protection, and the State Attorney General's Office.

Here's how to do it.

1. **Write a brief summary, defining the problem, brief pieces of evidence, and your desired solution**. Think of this as both the thesis and conclusion paragraphs of a 5 paragraph essay. You're going to attach all of your supporting evidence, but make it very clear what went wrong, how it went wrong, and what is required to make it right.
2. **Collect all of your _relevant_ evidence and include that in your document**. Make sure everything you include here is directly related to the problem and proof of the problem. I had dozens of screenshots showing issues with this company's website, but I intentionally limited it to specific, unambiguous issues. Far better to have 3 examples of clear wrongdoing than 3 examples of clear wrongdoing and 2 examples of a misunderstanding.
3. **Compile it all into a clean document**. You're going to be sending this to a number of different people, so make sure you do a good job of spellchecking, formatting, etc. Get someone else to read it over if you need: put an emphasis on clear vs. flowery.
4. **Address it to all parties involved**. When we did this, we printed 5 copies of the letter, addressed each one to one of the different groups we were sending to (4 agencies total and the scammers themselves) and wrote in each letter that we had written to all 5 of the groups. You want everyone to know that this is being widely distributed.
5. **Send it with certified mail**. This will cost you some money (in the range of $100 total) but it is absolutely required. According to the lawyers I spoke with, certified mail is basically 'undeniable'. The scamming group in question can't pretend that they didn't receive it, they can't claim ignorance. Sending certified mail means they basically have to respond.

## Step #6: Be Patient

You're now dealing with bureaucracy, and that can take time.
