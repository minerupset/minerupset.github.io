# How I Managed a Scam Foreclosure

It's not fun, but I'll show you the steps I took to organize the information

## Quick Background

What happened to us (refinance, new company, etc.)

## Key Point # 0: Take a Deep Breath

You'll need friends and help through this, so thank those around you for helping you, keep your eyes on the prize, etc.

## Key Point #1: Get a System

The way you beat these things is by being organized. To do that, you need a consistent location to store all of your thoughts and information on the topic.

For this particular situation, I used Microsoft OneNote, but there are other free and paid services you can use. If I were to do it again, I would probably go with Notion: it's free and very powerful. I'm going to describe everything below as if I were using Notion and Gmail as they are both free, but of course you can adapt to your tools as needed.

## Key Point #2: Information is Your Friend

Scammers try and pressure you with time and big / scary sounding repercussions if you don't do what they say. The way you take back power in this situation is to get educated. Now that you have a system for storing all your information, let's use it.

I made a daily post, titled with the date, detailing any activity that happened. If I logged in, if I had a phone call, if I got a form or a letter or email: everything was stored in there. It doesn't need to be long or well written, just recorded so that you can look back and actually know what happened.

## Key Point #3: Really Record Everything

When I said I made a post of everything that happened, I mean everything. If you get an email, copy and paste all of the text from the email into your daily post, and write a quick blurb at the top saying who you got it from, when, and your initial reactions.

If you have a phone call, record it. In the same way you hear, "This call may be monitored for training purposes" when someone calls you, you can do the same thing back. Inform them that you are recording the call (...steps on how to record).

## Key Point 4 (maybe earlier?) Be Clear About What Resolution is

I have a lawyer friend who said (and I'm paraphrasing), "I'm not here to make someone feel better: that's a therapist's job. I'm here to get them justice." For us, someone was trying to take our house (or at least, make us pay ~$7,000 as extortion for not foreclosing on us). The two main things we wanted were for that foreclosure notice to go away and for them to refund our escrow payments. While I had all kinds of frustrations with who they were as people, as my lawyer friend said, that's a conversation best for a therapist. I had to be very clear in all of my communications about what a 'correct' resolution would look like.
