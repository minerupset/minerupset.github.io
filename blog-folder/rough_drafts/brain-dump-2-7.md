Industrial vs. digital revolution and why millennials sit in a shit spot. You have a voice recording on this, but the industrial revolution scaled arithmetically, the digital revolution is scaling geometrically. We were raised by arithmetic parents, but the world was well on its way to geometric by the time we got out there, and our habits were not well equipped.

Giving a fuck means time, energy, $, and space. This last one has become key in the spaces in which we live. (Even the explosion of different adaptors, slowly solidifying into a single USB-C type).

We're seeing this in the digital space: there is currently a divergence of players who will store our information in the cloud, and we have to wonder how that will change. I was there as the cloud grew, and I have files strewn about in OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, and more. Where are younger generations storing their information? Is it diverging? Will we see it converge?

Article #1:

- How will space matter in the digital world? Tune in next time

Article #2:

- Millennials are a unique generation because of where we sit in the technological divide. We were raised by families rooted in arithmetic growth and expansion (how can I expand my business to hire more workers) vs. geometric growth (how can I scale so that we're growing 10x per year in our first few years).
