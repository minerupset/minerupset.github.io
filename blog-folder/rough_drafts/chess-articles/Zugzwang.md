# Zugzwang: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here

## [First Heading]

Zugzwang (pronounced more like _Tsug-svang_), this concept in chess describes a situation where every move for a given player is unfavorable, but they must make a move. While this typically presents itself in the endgame, this can happen at any point in the course of play.

See the following board as an example: (SHOW A SCREENSHOT OF A TWO PAWN GAME). At this moment, both players would rather not move: neither can advance their pawns, and but any movement of the king takes them away from protecting their piece.

(Can we tie this back to initiative?)
