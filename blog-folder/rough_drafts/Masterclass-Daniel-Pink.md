# Masterclass Summary: Daniel Pink Teaches Sales

Intro

## Why Selling is So Important

- We all do it so much, it's a key part of our lives

## Understand Your Audience

- Attunement
- Serving others
- Problem finding, not solving

## Instigating Change

- Framing
- Clarity

## Facing the Struggle

Churchill's quote "bouncing from failure without loss of enthusiasm quote"

- Buoyancy
- Interrogative self talk

## To Live is To Sell

- We all had to sell ourselves as valuable members of the group, one way or another
- If it feels greasy, think of it less like 'selling' and more like 'showing your value'. You can't show value that isn't there, so you have to actually provide value, and if you actually provide value, you can't expect everyone to see it automatically: maybe you have to communicate it. And if you're going to communicate it, you may as well do that effectively.
