# How I Managed To Avoid a Scam Foreclosure

_I'm not a lawyer, and nothing here constitutes legal advice. Instead, this is a description of how I myself dealt with a potential scam attempt and how I would do so again in the future._

In early 2021, my partner and I were victim's of an attempted scam from our new home loan servicing company. I won't be able to list their name here, but we'll call them ABC Servicers here. They sent us a bogus foreclosure notice in an attempt to get several thousand dollars out of us, using the fact that we were changing loan servicers as cover for their actions.

If this has happened to you, I'm sorry: it's not fun, but I'll show you the steps we took to organize our information and stop them from taking advantage of us. Although this happened to us around a home loan, this same process could help protect you from any kind of attempted scam where you can't escape from the other party, like a contractor, warranty, car loan, or other type of agreement.

## Quick Background

We refinanced our house in October of 2020, when interest rates were at their lowest. We locked in a great rate with a loan originator company, knowing that they would one day sell our loan to a servicing organization. You have no control who your loan is transferred to, but we didn't care. We had been with Wells Fargo for the first portion of our loan, and with all the bad press they had received, we figured we'd seen the worst of the bunch.

We were so very wrong.

We received notice in February that our loan had been transferred to ABC Servicers, and that we would receive a welcome letter, complete with all of the necessary information. We were also told that we could legally continue paying our previous servicer for 60 days, and that those payments could not be viewed as late by ABC. After two weeks had passed with no information, we payed our monthly payment to our originator, as we were allowed to do, and we kept on the lookout for information from ABC.

The first communication we got from them wasn't an email, or a welcome packet: it came two weeks after that first payment was due, and it was a foreclosure notice. We were told we were 45 days behind on payments, and that they would be beginning foreclosure proceedings against us.

## Step #0: Take a Deep Breath

A quote that I have used time and again has been, "Once you've decided to be angry, it doesn't help being angry anymore."

When we first received the foreclosure notice, our emotions were running high. That's not the worst thing in the world, but they have a limit. Emotions can be very useful for getting you to a decision point, but once you've made the decision, they don't seem to help much on the follow through.

The best thing I was able to do was take a deep breath. I can't pretend it fixed everything, but that wasn't the point: it gave me the space to think through the next steps. When someone is trying to use the legal system against you, it can be very disorienting. Keep your head about you and you'll be ok.

## Step #1: Build Your System

The way you beat these things is by being organized. The moment this kind of situation happens, it becomes a playground stand off of "Did to! Did not!" The best way to get out of this loop and get points on your side is clear, concrete evidence. For this evidence, you need:

- What is the evidence
- What does it mean (what wrongdoing does it point to)
- When did it happen
- Who sent it / by what mechanism (email, call, etc.)

Just saying someone did you wrong isn't going to help much, but screenshots, recordings, and documents are very hard to deny. To pull that off, you need a consistent system to store all of your thoughts and information on what's going on, and you'll want to be able to search for it as well.

For this particular situation with ABC, I used Microsoft OneNote. That said, there are other free and paid services you can use. If I were to do it again, I would probably go with Notion: it's free to use, has a clean UI, works on mobile and desktop, and is very easy to search.

## Step #2: Information is Your Friend

Scammers try and pressure you with short time and big, scary sounding repercussions if you don't do what they say. That first contact from ABC certainly hit that tone. No welcome email, no introduction, nothing. Just a letter stating we owed them over $7,000 and that we would lose the house in 45 days. That can be a frightening thing to wake up to any day of the week, but in the middle of a pandemic that was far less than welcome.

The way you take back power in a situation like that is to get educated. Now that you have a system for storing all your information (from Step 1), let's use it.

Every day there was any interaction with ABC in any capacity, I made a daily post, titled with the date, detailing any activity that happened. If I logged in to their website, if I had a phone call, if I got a form or a letter or email: everything was stored there. It doesn't need to be long or well written, just recorded so that you can look back, know what happened, and share that information with the right people.

When making these logs, don't just say what happened. You can also make notes saying how you are interpreting the events and what you plan to do next. This plan is going to change and adjust over time, and you want to be able to look back on what you were thinking and why. Don't write any threats or anything aggressive: remember, you may need to bring this to court. Be as clear and objective as possible.

## Step #3 Be Clear About What Resolution is

I have a lawyer friend who said, "I'm not here to make someone feel better: that's a therapist's job. I'm here to get them justice." For us, someone was trying to take our house (or at least, trying to extort us to prevent them foreclosing on us). The two main things we wanted were for that foreclosure notice to go away and for them to refund our escrow account, since we couldn't trust them to pay our bills anymore. While I had all kinds of frustrations with who they were as people, as my lawyer friend said, that's a conversation best for a therapist. I had to be very clear in all of my communications about what a 'correct' resolution would look like.

This can be a bit challenging because to find a resolution, you have to get very concrete about what they did that was wrong. The company sending me an email that scared me isn't illegal: that's a purely subjective thing. But I took the time, read up on the law (if you're in this situation, the law you're looking for is RESPA[^1]) and found clear clauses that they had violated, such as not honoring payments during the transition period between servicers. You're not going after the soft fuzzy thing they did that bothered you: your focus should be on the very clear, one sentence statement, "They did X, and that is illegal because of Y, and I want them to do Z to make up for it".

Once you have that vision of what a resolution is, make that the clear goal. I wouldn't have said no to dunking their C-suite in a vat of acid, but that's not a goal the legal system would have been behind. I had to set my sights to a lower, but more realistic goal.

## Step #4: Really Record Everything

When I said I made a daily post of everything that happened, I mean everything. If you get an email, copy and paste all of the text from the email into your daily post. Write a quick blurb at the top saying who you got it from, when, and your initial reactions to the message. Does it contradict what someone else said? Has the tone changed? Summarize the big points.

If you have a phone call, record it. In the same way you hear, "This call may be monitored for training purposes" when someone calls you, you can do the same thing back. Make sure to inform them that you are recording the call, but that can go both ways. The best way I was able to do it was using my phone on speaker phone, I would open some type of audio recording software on my computer, my wife's computer, or even use her phone to make sure that I had a clear recording of what was going on.

## Step #5: Find the Adult in the Room

This may be the single most important point here, if only because it brings it all together: the only thing that stops a bad lawyer is a good lawyer. If you are getting scammed, you need to find the right group who is invested in making sure this doesn't happen. I live in California, a state that luckily has many consumer protections: I wound up reaching out to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (a national organization), the California Department of Financial Protection, and the State Attorney General's Office.

Here's how to do it.

1. **Write a brief summary, defining the problem, brief pieces of evidence, and your desired solution**. Think of this as both the thesis and conclusion paragraphs of a 5 paragraph essay. You're going to attach all of your supporting evidence, but make it very clear what went wrong, how it went wrong, and what is required to make it right.
2. **Collect all of your _relevant_ evidence and include that in your document**. Make sure everything you include here is directly related to the problem and proof of the problem. I had dozens of screenshots showing issues with this company's website, but I intentionally limited it to specific, unambiguous issues. Far better to have 3 examples of clear wrongdoing than 3 examples of clear wrongdoing and 2 examples of a misunderstanding.
3. **Compile it all into a clean document**. You're going to be sending this to a number of different people, so make sure you do a good job of spellchecking, formatting, etc. Get someone else to read it over if you need: put an emphasis on clear vs. flowery.
4. **Address it to all parties involved**. When we did this, we printed 5 copies of the letter, addressed each one to one of the different groups we were sending to (4 agencies total and the scammers themselves) and wrote in each letter that we had written to all 5 of the groups. You want everyone to know that this is being widely distributed.
5. **Send it with certified mail**. This will cost you some money (in the range of $100 total) but it is absolutely required. According to the lawyers I spoke with, certified mail is basically 'undeniable'. The scamming group in question can't pretend that they didn't receive it, they can't claim ignorance. Sending certified mail means they basically have to respond.

## Step #6: Be Patient

You're now dealing with bureaucracy, and that can take time.
