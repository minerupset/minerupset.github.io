# Unpopular Opinion: Why Excel & VBA are the best gateway to coding

Spreadsheets get a lot of bad press in today's day and age. At best, they're drudgery that people hate and make memes about [INSERT MEME HERE]. At worst, errors and flaws in these sheets lead to massive mistakes to the tune of billions of dollars [Error in the Norway analysis and impact of debt]. I am not here to say that these view points are wrong, or even short-sighted: the modern spreadsheet has been implicated as a tool in the wrongdoings of executives at Theranos[^1], Enron, and are regularly used as evidence in cases of fraud, trying to determine whether the business users were intentionally fudging numbers or just bad at math.

However, this isn't the point: Excel (and by Extension, Google Sheets) is here to stay[^2], and as long as they are used in the business world, having a grounding in the capabilities and basic functions will be an advantage to just about any employee. But even more than that, I believe that for anyone looking to break into the world of software development, especially if you are coming from a corporate job, that Excel combined with its back-end language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is one of the best tools out there to learn practical skills needed for software development.

## The Uncomfortable Middle

Making this claim will likely make me enemies on both sides of the fence. Experienced developers can look down on the tinker-toys that Excel has to offer, with its static processing and point-and-click interface (not to mention the garbage pile that is VBA syntax compared to any modern language). Meanwhile Frustrated business users can point to Excel's inconsistent formula conventions and general feature sprawl as proof that Excel is simply too unwieldy to invest any more time than is necessary. To them I say: you're right (sort of).

Excel is not a great long term software development tool, nor should someone invest all of their time learning its ins and outs (unless they fancy themselves as a competitor in the Excel eSports realm [^3]). But here are a few reasons why deep Excel knowledge can give you an edge in the business world and even help push you towards a career change.

## Practicality From the Beginning

- You can build useful things vs. theoretical things (talk about your own college vs. business experience)

## No Making Apple Pies from Scratch

- The environment comes pre-made

## Big Concepts, Bite-Sized Projects

- When done correctly, can introduce useful coding concepts (OOP, SRP, even web development concepts of front end, backend, and database)
